🛠️ Maintenance Prediction Project

This project aims to predict whether maintenance is required based on a set of input features using various machine learning models. The best model is selected through hyperparameter tuning and evaluation.

🚀 Features

Multiple Model Evaluation: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Gradient Boosting models were trained and evaluated.
Hyperparameter Tuning: GridSearchCV was used to find the best parameters for each model.
Performance Metrics: Models were evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

🧰 Tech Stack

Python: Core programming language.
scikit-learn: For model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
